Tips: 
Heroku has a set of default buildpacks, used when it needs to detect the language of your app.

In order to do that detection, it runs the bin/detect command of each of those default buildpacks, until one of them returns a 0 exit code.

This is the command for the node buildpack. it requires a package.json to be located at the root of your app, not in a subfolder.
